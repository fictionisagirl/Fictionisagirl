Hi, I'm Kas, or Fiction 👋
Trust & Safety | AI Behavioral Analyst | Intelligence Specialist
I am a high-velocity learner and technical researcher transitioning into the Generative AI Safety and Information Integrity space. My focus is on identifying and mitigating emergent model risks—specifically "AI Psychosis" (semantic drift)—and developing objective, non-biased intelligence frameworks. My background in Trust and Safety, especially as an SME in Misinformation, Hate Speech, and Dangerous Groups gives me an edge in finding those same patterns in LLM conversations.  Preventing AI from encouraging this type of behavior, or causing a person to harm themselves or others is a major goal of mine. 

🚀 Current Mission: Skill Upgrading
I am currently in an intensive "technical sprint," rapidly expanding my toolkit to solve complex safety problems at scale:

Languages: Python (Focus: Adversarial Testing Scripts), SQL (Focus: Data Integrity & Threat Detection).

Focus Areas: LLM Hallucination Metrics, OSINT Verification, and Model Robustness.

Philosophy: Safety enforcement must be rooted in rigorous, non-politically biased intelligence and objective data analysis.

🛠️ Active Projects
GenAI-Drift-Audit: A Python-based tool to quantify semantic variance and detect signs of model instability/psychosis.

Currently unnamed project: Working on a framework for automated OSINT verification of synthetic media.

⚡ The "Fast Learner" Edge
I specialize in synthesizing complex, evolving information into actionable safety policies. My background allows me to bridge the gap between technical "glitches" and human-centric safety risks. I am currently open to connecting with Trust & Safety professionals who value neutrality, transparency, and proactive risk management.
